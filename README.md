# CarbonFlow: The CarbonCapture Innovations Marketplace

**Submission for the Code4Hope 2025 Hackathon (Sustainability Track)**

## üöÄ The Problem
For a company like **CarbonCapture Innovations**, capturing CO‚ÇÇ is only half the battle. The real challenge is transforming that captured carbon from a costly liability into a valuable asset. They "struggle with what to do with the captured carbon," which limits their growth and impact.

##üí° Our Solution
CarbonFlow is an intelligent B2B marketplace that creates an ecosystem for the circular carbon economy. We connect CO‚ÇÇ producers directly with consumers, using an advanced AI consultant to provide deep, strategic insights that turn potential partnerships into profitable, sustainable ventures.
