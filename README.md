# CarbonCapture Innovations Marketplace

A B2B platform connecting CO₂ producers with consumers to create a circular carbon economy. Developed for the Code4Hope 2025 Hackathon.

## Problem Focus
[cite_start]Tackling the challenge from CarbonCapture Innovations [cite: 48][cite_start], we address the high cost of carbon capture by creating a market for captured CO₂, turning an environmental liability into a financial asset[cite: 49].

## Features
* **Producer/Consumer Registration:** Users can register as CO₂ suppliers or consumers.
* **Interactive Matchmaking Map:** Select a producer to see all viable, geographically-close consumer matches visualized on an interactive map.
* **Supply/Demand Algorithm:** Our backend automatically filters matches to ensure a producer's supply can meet a consumer's demand.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React, Vite, Leaflet.js
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Database:** JSON file-based (for MVP)

## How to Run
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run the backend: `cd backend`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python app.py`.
3.  Run the frontend: `cd frontend`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`.
